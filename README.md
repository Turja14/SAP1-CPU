# SAP1-CPU

<a id="overview"></a>
## Introduction

This project showcases the design of a Simple-As-Possible (SAP-1) CPU implemented using Logisim Evolution, serving as an introductory model for understanding CPU architecture.

The CPU design incorporates a fully functional hardwired control unit, automating the key processes of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions. A significant enhancement in this version is the integration of a ROM-based bootloader, which automates the loading of machine code programs into the CPU's memory, removing the need for manual input. As a result, the project successfully executes a simple addition operation, where two predefined 8-bit values are loaded, summed, stored, shifted and rotated in memory, illustrating the CPU's operational flow.
